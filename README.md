notes:

1. I started the project on my computer and suddenly it didn't work so I took a computer from my friend (Miri Ehrenfeld)
   therefore the last commit was uploaded from her username.
2. At the moment there is a problem that there will be more than one house registered, 
   a problem in Mongo with the automatically generated ID (a known problem but due to the lack of time I could not research and fix it) 
   I will fix it and upload a fix to GitHub in the meantime if you want to create another house you have to delete the previous one 
   ( I wrote a ready house delete function for this...)
